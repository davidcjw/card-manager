# Credit Card Manager

A comprehensive credit card management application built with Next.js and TypeScript. Track your credit cards, monitor spending, and stay on top of important dates and limits.

## Features

### Credit Card Management
- Add, edit, and delete credit cards
- Track spending by category
- Monitor earning rates and caps
- Set credit limits and annual fees
- Track payment due dates and annual fee dates

### Smart Alerts System
The application automatically generates alerts for:

1. **Payment Due Alerts** - Notifies you when payments are due within 7 days
2. **Annual Fee Alerts** - Reminds you of upcoming annual fees within 30 days
3. **Fee Waiver Opportunities** - Alerts when you're close to spending enough to waive annual fees
4. **Category Spending Limit Alerts** - Warns when you're approaching monthly spending caps for specific categories (80% threshold)
5. **Credit Limit Alerts** - Notifies when you're approaching your credit limit (80% threshold)

### Alert Types

#### Category Spending Limit Alerts
- Triggered when spending reaches 80% or more of the monthly cap for a specific category
- Shows remaining amount before hitting the cap
- Helps you maximize rewards while staying within limits

#### Credit Limit Alerts
- Triggered when total spending reaches 80% or more of your credit limit
- Shows remaining available credit
- Helps you manage credit utilization and avoid over-limit fees
