A comprehensive credit card management application built with Next.js and TypeScript. Track your credit cards, monitor spending, and stay on top of important dates and limits.

No data is collected. Everything is stored in your browser's local storage and you are free to download the data in JSON format to share with others (e.g. your spouse).

Feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/davidcjw/card-manager/issues) for bugs or feature requests.

The application automatically generates alerts for:

1. **Payment Due Alerts** - Notifies you when payments are due within 7 days
2. **Annual Fee Alerts** - Reminds you of upcoming annual fees within 30 days
3. **Fee Waiver Opportunities** - Alerts when you're close to spending enough to waive annual fees
4. **Category Spending Limit Alerts** - Warns when you're approaching monthly spending caps for specific categories (80% threshold)
5. **Credit Limit Alerts** - Notifies when you're approaching your credit limit (80% threshold)

### Alert Types
